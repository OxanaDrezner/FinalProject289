### ***About***    
This project demonstates a **smart** and **easily maintained** automation infrastructure. It is built with "divide and conquer" approach and inheritance using packages like: Utilities, Extensions, PageObjects and Workflows. This way, test methods created very simply and comprehensibly with a minimum lines of code while leaving **ALL** of configuration data in external xml file. This kind of infrastructure supports differend types of platforms thus providing homogeneity, order and organization in managing automation testing.
